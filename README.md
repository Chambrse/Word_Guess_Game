This app focusses on event listeners. The main one used in my solution is onKeyup. Other things sprinkled in include some simple input validation, string manipulation, and more dynamically generated elements.

To play, load the page, and simply press keys on your keyboard to start guessing. The app keeps track of which letters you've already guessed, and how many chances you have left to finish the word.

It's time to test your knowledge! A proper lord or lady should know the histories of westeros.
